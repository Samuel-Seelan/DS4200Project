      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Our analysis of SFO’s air traffic from 1999 to 2023 revealed several important trends. As demonstrated by the interactive figures - passenger traffic was generally on a steady upward trajectory before the COVID-19 pandemic, with notable growth in domestic and international travel. The pandemic, however, caused a sharp and immediate disruption in early 2020, which is clearly visible in both the bubble chart and COVID timeline. Despite this setback, carriers such as United and Southwest maintained strong market positions, and new dynamics emerged during the recovery period. Visualisations like the Sankey diagram also revealed how terminal usage varies significantly by airline and destination region, with United dominating Terminal 3 and international carriers concentrated in the International Terminal. Overall, our findings highlight how major global events (e.g. the September 11th attacks in 2001 and the COVID-19 pandemic), airline strategy, and airport infrastructure shape long-term passenger flow and regional connectivity at a major transit hub like SFO.

      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      </p>
        Looking ahead, future work could expand this analysis in both scope and depth. Incorporating flight-level data—such as departure times, delays, and on-time performance—would allow us to investigate operational efficiency alongside passenger volume. Additionally, integrating real-time weather and global event data could help model external factors influencing traffic trends. On the visualisation side, enhancing interactivity and accessibility—such as mobile responsiveness, filtering by airline type or region, or embedding predictive models—could further engage users and aid decision-makers. Collaborating with airport authorities or data providers to obtain richer, granular datasets, including demographic insights or travel purpose, could lead to even more impactful findings on airport dynamics and air travel behaviour.
